**Niggflex** is a comprehensive movie portal built on the Kinopoisk API, offering users an extensive range of information about films and TV shows. Users can discover details such as release dates, box office performance, cast members, interesting facts, and recommendations for similar works. The platform features a robust authentication system that includes email confirmation, login functionality, and user sessions based on JWT. Users have the ability to personalize their profile by marking films as "liked" or "watched" and can conveniently manage their profile settings. The platform also includes a dedicated section called "Favorites" where users can easily access and revisit their preferred works.

The client-side of Niggflex is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To handle state management, the widely adopted solution RTK (Redux Toolkit) is utilized, ensuring efficient and effective management of data flow within the application. On the server side, Express, a flexible web application framework, is used in conjunction with the MongoDB database. This combination provides a reliable and optimal solution for developing a REST API, catering to the needs of Niggflex without unnecessary complexity.
